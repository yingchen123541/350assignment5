purpose: build a student data base with student and faculty information
         users will be able to choose different options and insert or remove elements in data base
         or to view the information in the data base

error: make sure you go back to the original studentTable and facultyTable each time after you run one options
       cause changes in student advisor doesn't change advisee in facultytable (we didn't inplement it)
       it will mess up other options if don't go back to the origin studentTable and facultyTable after outputing options
